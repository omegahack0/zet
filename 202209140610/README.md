# How to make a zettel entry

This is the body of the zettle entry ( or "slip").

* First Bullet
* Second Bullet

But, when I have a numbered list

1. First 
1. Second
1. Third

What if I want *italic* or **bold** or ***bolditalics***?

How about something that looks like 'code'?

And when I have a URL I want it to print so I write it out like this
https://rwx.gg

* I put reference at the bottom
